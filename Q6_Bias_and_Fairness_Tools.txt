6. Bias & Fairness Tools

Visit Aequitas Bias Audit Tool.
Choose a bias metric (e.g., false negative rate parity) and describe:
â€¢	What the metric measures
â€¢	Why it's important
â€¢	How a model might fail this metric
Optional: Try applying the tool to any small dataset or use demo data.


What the Metric Measures:
False Negative Rate (FNR) Parity checks whether different demographic groups experience the same rate of false negatives â€” that is, how often the model misses positive cases for each group.

A false negative occurs when the model incorrectly predicts a negative outcome for someone who truly belongs to the positive class.

FNR Parity ensures that this error type is distributed fairly across all groups (e.g., gender, race, income level).

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Important:
FNR parity is crucial in high-stakes decisions, such as:

Predicting eligibility for public assistance

Medical diagnosis

Loan approvals

A high false negative rate for a specific group can deny rightful opportunities or treatments, leading to systemic discrimination or disadvantaged outcomes.

How a Model Might Fail This Metric:
Letâ€™s say a model is used to predict who should receive extra job training. If it has a higher FNR for women than men, it will fail to identify eligible women more often. As a result:

Qualified women may be excluded

The training program becomes inequitable

It reinforces existing societal biases

Such a model, though seemingly accurate overall, would fail FNR parity and be flagged as unfair by Aequitas.
